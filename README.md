## Issues

- While the Stay Focused toggle code is active and the game continues to run while unfocused, audio and animations may occasionally repeat. This is due to the way the game uses DOTween for its tweens and is a reported and unresolved issue with the library. There is no planned fix, if you need to turn the toggle code off.
